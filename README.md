# EST Design System

Note: This project is at the proposal stage.

### What

EST Design System repository will contain standards, design principles and guidelines in support of digital design at Energy Saving Trust. In addition, the library will include an array of reusable components, patterns and utilities.

### Why

Expanding catalogue of online tools, websites and services combined with rapid growth of our digital efforts comes a need to coordinate and streamline our design work. Teams and collegues will be able to leverage EST Design System to manage and accelerate design initiatives at scale. 

Design System will provide a lot of benefits:

* Library of reusable components and design resources will help our teams to focus on solving more-complex design problems (like user workflows or information usability rather than basic visual tweaks).
* Centralised design resource will act as a knowledge platform. Codified product knowledge, discoveries and best practicises will be shared and widely available.
* Unified design language will improve alignment between crossfunctional teams. 
* Component library will provide immediate and robust visual layer for wide range of software and data projects (or experiments). 
* Design System will improve understanding and usage consistency of the EST Brand. 
* help people to showcase their
* To enable rapid reuse to
* Design (and development) work can be created and replicated quickly and at scale.
* Design (and development) work can be created and replicated quickly and at scale.
